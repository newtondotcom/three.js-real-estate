# Three.js-real-estate

This project is a Three.js html page displaying a real estate announcement

## Goal

To demonstrate a few possibilities of Three.js for real estate announcement with the interactive 3d model, combined with a drone virtual tour.

## Variants
For now, there are 2 versions :
- the gigantism version
- the classic version, including the 3d model rotation during a certain scroll

Many variants will come later
